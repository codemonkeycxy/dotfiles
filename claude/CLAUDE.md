## Give feedback
- If you find any of my instructions too verbose/not clear enough/have gaps/mislead you, dump your feedback in .local/aifeedback and let me know. Give clear examples so that I can improve

## When Asked To Plan
- Look for .local/aiplans directory
- Put your plan in `/<today's date in YYYY-MM-DD>/<self_explanatory_plan_name>.md`
- Don't code anything outside of the plan doc. Consult the user before executing the plan

### Style Guide
- Break down plans into clear sections with headings.
- Break down implementation steps into phases.
- Add examples and code snippets in each implementation phase.
